Configuring ToDD
================================

ToDD uses configuration files (typically found in /etc/todd) to control it's behavior. The server and the agent use their own individual config files, and sample files are shown below.

.. topic:: NOTE

   Configuration files for both the ToDD Server and ToDD Agent binaries load once at initial start. So, in order to apply any changes to the configuration, these processes need to be restarted.

First, the server configuration file (usually /etc/todd/server/cfg) contains configurations for all services that the server will require - things like integrated databases, communications plugins, and internal calculations. Here is a sample server configuration file, with comments inline:

Server Configuration
--------------------

.. code-block:: text

    [API]
    Host = 0.0.0.0
    Port = 8080

    # DEPRECATED SOON! (This was the original configuration for comms, but this
    # AMQP section will be condensed under the "Comms" section soon.)
    [AMQP]
    User = guest
    Password = guest
    Host = 192.168.0.10
    Port = 5672

    [Comms]
    Plugin = rabbitmq

    # ToDD's Assets API - allows agents to download assets like collectors, testlets, etc.
    [Assets] 
    IP = 0.0.0.0
    Port = 8090

    [DB]
    IP = 192.168.0.10
    Port = 4001
    Plugin = etcd

    [TSDB]
    IP = 192.168.0.10
    Port = 8086
    Plugin = influxdb

    [Grouping]
    Interval = 10   # Interval (in seconds) for the grouping calculation to run on the server

    [Testing]
    Timeout = 30   # This is the timer (in seconds) that a test will be allowed to live

    [LocalResources]
    DefaultInterface = eth0
    IPAddrOverride = 10.128.0.2 # Normally, the DefaultInterface configuration option is used to get IP address. This overrides that in the event that it doesn't work
    OptDir = /opt/todd/server

Agent Configuration
-------------------

The agent configuration is fairly simpler than the server configuration - largely because the agent doesn't integrate directly with the databases that the server does.

.. code-block:: text

    # DEPRECATED SOON! (This was the original configuration for comms, but this
    # AMQP section will be condensed under the "Comms" section soon.)
    [AMQP]
    User = guest
    Password = guest
    Host = 10.128.0.2
    Port = 5672

    [Comms]
    Plugin = rabbitmq

    [LocalResources]
    DefaultInterface = eth0
    # IPAddrOverride = 192.168.99.100  # Normally, the DefaultInterface configuration option is used to get IP address. This overrides that in the event that it doesn't work
    OptDir = /opt/todd/agent
